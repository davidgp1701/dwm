# David's Personal DWM configuration

This contains my forked version of DWM. A bit convoluted to sync with the original DWM repository and apply new versions of the patches as they are available. Not something to be doing everyday.

## Branches

Each of the branches of this repo contains the following the changes:

* `master` - Just original branch to sync with DWM git's repository.
* `config` - My personal configuration file.
